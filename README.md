# FactorDB_Checker
This is a script from a library I am working on (don't know when it will be published to keep you hyped :P) that helps you check fast if a number n is composite or not from FactorDB.

# Preparation
- Install requests: `pip3 install requests`

- Done!

# Execution
`python3 FactorDB_Checker.py`
